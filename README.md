# Module 12 Report 

## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate loan risk
* The model was based off of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company
* Using a logistic regression model, we are predicting the healthhy loan and high-risk loans using the creditworthiness of borrowers 
* First, I split the data into training and test sets. I used a logistic regression model with the original data, then predicted a logistic regression model with resampled training data


## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    - Model 1 Accuracy: 99%
    
    - Label 0 Precision: 100%
    - Label 0 Recall: 99%
    
    - Label 1 Precision: 85%
    - Label 1 Recall: 91%


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  
  Unknown

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best? Unsure of performance ranking due to second model malfunction.

* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
    It appears that the precision and recall is better when predicting the 0s (Healthy loan)

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
